			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am currently a student at the <span class="uw">University of Waterloo</span> and the <span class="wlu">Wilfrid Laurier University</span> pursuing degrees in <span class="uw">Computer Science (UW)</span> and <span class="wlu"> Business Administration (WLU)</span>. So far, it has been an incredible experience as I get to explore and learn about various areas of computer science, mathematics, business, and economics. I have an interest in technology, entrepreneurship, and digital media and am always looking for opportunities to learn, develop, and enhance my understanding and experience in these areas and more. I also very highly value commmunity and love helping out where I can in whatever ways I can. Feel free to check out some of my <a href="http://github.com/murizvi">projects</a> and <a href="#">reach out</a> if you think I could have a role to play in your own (whether for work, or as a volunteer).</p>
